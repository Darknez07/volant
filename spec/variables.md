Variables represent a block of memory.
Declared using the ':' operator:
```
variable: type;
```

The memory allocated to the variables is not initialized when they are declared.
Initializing a variable is done using the '=' operator:
```
variable: type; // declares an uninitialized variable
variable = 0; // initializes the variable with value '0'
```
